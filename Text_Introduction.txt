Project: Register of agents and secret missions

End user: Executive officer with responsibility of mission-agent assignments

Description: This software offers basic handling of agent-to-mission assignment.
One agent can be assigned to various missions, just as one mission might require more than one agent.

cz.muni.fi.agentproject.Agent parameters:
- id (clearly identifiable)
- name
- date of birth
- description
User will be able to get an agent from external sources, update his parameters and track him by his ID, as well as track all hired agents at once. Once user decides there is no more need for the agent, he can silently and humanely kill him in order to retain all the sensitive data in private.

cz.muni.fi.agentproject.Mission parameters:
- id (clearly identifiable)
- description
- requiredAgents
- goal
User will be allowed to create a mission, update its parameters and once it has been completed, delete it from the database so that it cannot be used as compromising evidence. Missions can also be tracked one by one by their ID or all at once.

Assignment parameters:
- id (clearly identifiable)
- agent
- mission
- start time
- end time
Through assignments, user appoints agents to their respective missions. Assignments can be created, their parameters updated and once completed, they can be safely deleted from the database without any trace. They can be tracked by their ID or all at once. For the maximum user comfort, this software also provides methods that can find available missions for given agent and vice versa - to find available agents for given mission.
